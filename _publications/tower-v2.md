In this work, we present TOWER-V2, an improved iteration of the state-of-the-art openweight TOWER models, and the backbone of our submission to the WMT24 General Translation shared task. TOWER-V2 introduces key improvements including expanded language coverage, enhanced data quality, and increased model capacity up to 70B parameters. Our final submission combines these advancements with quality-aware decoding strategies, selecting translations based on multiple translation quality signals. The resulting system demonstrates significant improvement over previous versions, outperforming closed commercial systems like GPT-4O, CLAUDE-SONNET-3.5, and DEEPL even at a smaller 7B scale.
